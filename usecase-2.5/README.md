# SIESTA - work package 15 - use case 2.5

This implements an SPM analysis on fMRI data that was recorded from participans engaged in a visual task.

The pipeline is expected to be executed on a Linux computer and MATLAB R2020b.

## Input data

The input data is freely available from "OpenNeuro" with the Accession Number [ds004934](https://doi.org/10.18112/openneuro.ds004934.v1.0.0). The dataset includes 44 subjects who are divided into two experiments: 17 subjects undergo fMRIs dedicated to experiment 1, whereas 29 subjects undergo fMRIs dedicated to experiment 2.

The input data consists of about 1548 files with a combined size of 18.63G. The data can be downloaded using the Amazon [AWS command-line interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) or using [datalad](https://www.datalad.org/).

```console
mkdir input
aws s3 cp --recursive --no-sign-request s3://openneuro.org/ds004934/ input
```

To resume a partially complete download that was interrupted you can do

```console
aws s3 sync --no-sign-request s3://openneuro.org/ds004934/ input
```

Alternatively, you can download the data with the openneuro [cli](https://docs.openneuro.org/packages/openneuro-cli.html) (requires Node.js v18 or higher to be installed). To install a specific (latest) version of Node.js you can [install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) and manage your node installation(s) from there:

```console
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install node    # "node" is an alias for the latest version
```

If your node installation is up-to-date and working then make sure you have an openneuro account and in a new termminal run:

```console
npm install -g @openneuro/cli

openneuro login
openneuro download ds004934 -s 1.0.0 input
```

Tip: Use e.g. Node.js version 21.7.3 if you get errors from the openneuro client

### Legal aspects of the input data

The input dataset has been released under the [CC0](https://spdx.org/licenses/CC0-1.0.html) license.

## Output data

The to-be-shared data in the output folder has the following directory structure:

```console
|-- groupresults
|   |-- DOTS_run-001
|   |-- DOTS_run-002
|   |-- Motion_run-001
|   |-- Motion_run-002
|   |-- spWM_run-001
|   `-- spWM_run-002
```

Besides this, the output folder contains the per-subject intermediate (first-level) results. Those results are not to be shared and should not be on the whitelist

The `whitelist.txt` file contains a complete list of the output data that is to be shared.

## Analysis pipeline

### Legal aspects of the software

MATLAB is commercial software.

SPM is open source software that is released under the GPLv2 license.

The code that is specific to the analysis pipeline is shared under the CC0 license.

### Software installation

This requires the Github source repository, SPM and MATLAB software.

```console
git clone https://github.com/SIESTA-eu/wp15.git

cd wp15/usecase-2.5
wget https://github.com/spm/spm12/archive/refs/tags/r7771.zip
unzip r7771.zip
mv spm12-r7771 spm12
rm r7771.zip 
```

Alternatively, you can install the software in an Apptainer container image.

```console
cd wp15/usecase-2.5
apptainer build usecase-2.5.sif container.def
```

### Executing the pipeline

Executing the pipeline from the MATLAB command window is done like this:

```matlab
cd wp15/usecase-2.5
restoredefaultpath
addpath spm12
addpath spm12/config
addpath spm12/matlabbatch
addpath work

bidsapp input output participant
bidsapp input output group
```

Executing the pipeline from the Linux terminal is done using:

```console
cd wp15/usecase-2.5
matlab -batch "cd wp15/usecase-2.5; restoredefaultpath; addpath work spm12 spm12/config spm12/matlabbatch; bidsapp input output participant"
matlab -batch "cd wp15/usecase-2.5; restoredefaultpath; addpath work spm12 spm12/config spm12/matlabbatch; bidsapp input output group"
```

Executing the pipeline from the Apptainer image is done like this:

```console
apptainer run --env MLM_LICENSE_FILE=port@server usecase-2.5.sif input output participant
apptainer run --env MLM_LICENSE_FILE=port@server usecase-2.5.sif input output group
```

## Cleaning up

Cleaning up the input and output data is done using:

```console
rm -rf input output
```

## Scrambled data

As in SIESTA the data is assumed to be sensitive, the analysis is conceived to be designed and implemented on a scrambled version of the dataset. Note that that is not needed here, as the original input and output data can be accessed directly.

 A scrambled version of the data can be generated using [BIDScramble](https://github.com/SIESTA-eu/wp15/tree/main/BIDScramble).

```console
scramble input output stub
scramble input output json -p '(?!AcquisitionTime).*'
scramble input output nii permute y -i
```
